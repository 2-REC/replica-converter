# replica-converter
Level files converter for the "Replica Engine" * (TODO: add link to "replica-engine" repository).

Level files used by the original "Replica Island" code need to be adapted to be used by the modified "Replica Engine". This tool can be used to automate this conversion.

More information can be found in the "docs" directory.

* "Replica Engine" is the adaptation of the "Replica Island" Android game (TODO: add link to "replica-island" repository & website?) to make it more generic and easier to use as a game engine (with reduced code modifications required and increased data oriented generation).
